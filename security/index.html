<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The focus of this assessment is to gauge the security of a web application
   developed by Colin Hamilton for Ming Chow's <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/">Web Programming Course</a>. This application was designed as a tool to 
   track and display the locations of professors, characters, and other
   students on a map, much like Harry Potter's "Marauder's Map". This application was produced in two phases-- <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a2.html"> one phase </a> focused on the client-side user interface that displayed the map and its current markers, while
   the <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">second phase</a> was developed to provide the backend server and database
   infrastructure of the application. </p><p>My purpose here is to assess any 
   vulnerabilities within this web application,
   determine their severity, and provide recommendations on how to resolve
   these issues.</p>
