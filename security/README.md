Security Assessment by Susie Church

1. I believe I have correctly done all aspects of this 
assignment.

2. I collaborated with Sophie Dasinger in talking
about approaches to attack.

I also used the "github.css" file I found through resources on the comp 20 website
to mimick the look of markdown in CSS. I gave proper acknowledgements in the comments
of this document.

3. I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment.
