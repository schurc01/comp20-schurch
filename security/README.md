Security Assessment
--------------------

In this assigment, we had to write a security assessment of another student's web application. We were to find 4 security flaws within their code, explain why they are a problem, and show how a person could utilize those vulnerabilities.

I used the "github.css" file I found through resources on the comp 20 website
to mimick the look of markdown in CSS. I gave proper acknowledgements in the comments
of this document.
