I spent approximately two hours on this assignment. I believe I implemented
everything correctly, though I could havemade my code more modular by not
hard coding the currentTimes. However, after struggling with it for a while,
it seemed to be the most trustworthy way to complete the lab. I worked on
debugging my code for this lab with Sophie Dasinger.
