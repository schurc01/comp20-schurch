Karaoke Lab
-------------

This lab assignment was our first using JavaScript. We were tasked with creating a karaoke-style experience for the music video for "Daydream Believer" by the Monkees. As the song played, the current lyrics had to be displayed.

I spent approximately two hours on this assignment. I believe I implemented
everything correctly, though I could havemade my code more modular by not
hard coding the currentTimes. However, after struggling with it for a while,
it seemed to be the most trustworthy way to complete the lab. I worked on
debugging my code for this lab with Sophie Dasinger.
