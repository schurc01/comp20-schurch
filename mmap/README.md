	1. I believe I have correctly implemented all parts of this assignment. I successfully 
	used geolocation to display my location on the map, as well as return the students
	and characters locations using unique markers and infowindows. The sorted distances
	of the characters from me are listed in the infowindow of my unique cat marker, which
	you can see by clicking on my marker.

	2. I worked on this project alone

	3. I spent approximately 10 hours completing this assignment
