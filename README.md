Hello, world.
===========

What is the purpose of this repository?
---------------------------------------
The purpose of this repository is to hold all assignments from my Fall 2014 Web Programming class at Tufts University. 


What was my favorite assignment?
-------------------------------
My favorite assignment would have to be our "Marauder's Map". It was one of my first times working with JavaScript. It's ease of use and power really excited and inspired me to work on other side projects, as well as offered me many new tools to do so.

How have I grown?
-----------------
I believe this course has given me a lot of new insight into the vast world of Computer Science. Moreover, it's given me an important and full introduction to the ever-changing realm of web programming. While I came in with little to no web experience, I come out of this class feeling comfortable with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, and many other frameworks to support those technologies. Furthermore, this class introduced just a taste of web security-- while not extensive, it was enough to make me order a few books for over winter break and consider honing my interests to more in that area.

What is the most important thing I've learned?
----------------------------------------------
NEVER. TRUST. CLIENT. DATA. No but seriously, it's difficult me to piece out one specific thing. If I had to choose, I would probably say that being introduced to JavaScript in a formal way has opened so many doors for me. JavaScript is the foundation of so many powerful things in our world today, and as such it can be daunting to dive into without help. Also, it is too often that people learn the frameworks and technologies built on JS without ever learning the basics. I feel that getting those basics has helped me have a much deeper and more stable understanding of the field. I have already used my newfound JavaScript foundation by coding in D3.js for my Visualization course, and using JQuery to further my personal website. Without the introduction that Ming gave us this semester, I'm not sure I would've feel comfortable enough to jump into those projects as I did.

What topic would I like to delve deeper into?
-----------------------------------------------
While I'm sure I will keep using JavaScript daily for various projects, I think that security is a topic I must learn more about. It's challenging, exciting and extremely important. Furthermore, it does not seem like many programmers are interested in it as there should be. The field needs people! I will start by trying to teach myself some more basics, and hopefully take the security class at Tufts in the near future.
