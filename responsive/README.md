I believe that all aspects of this lab have been correctly implemented.
I made sure to correctly implement the min and max widths, and show the
corresponding images.

I collaborated with Sophie Dasinger by generally talking about the
premise of this lab. 

I spend approximately 20 minutes on this lab.
