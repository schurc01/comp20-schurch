I have correctly rendered the Google Map over Tufts University. I was not able
to render any of the MBTA data on the screen. It is not possible to request
the real-time data from MBTA using XMLHttpRequest because of the same-origin
policy. 

I spent approximately three hours on this assignment.

I worked with Sophie Dasinger on this assignment.
